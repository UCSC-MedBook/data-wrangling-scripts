## Importing TPM Data to MedBook

TPM data comes out of the RNA-Seq pipeline as a column in the `RSEM/rsem_genes.results` file.
It needs to undergo the following transformations&mdash;that do not apply to norm_counts data&mdash;before being imported into MedBook:
* Extract TPM column and feature labels column from file
* Update header to contain sample ID
* Update feature labels from ensembl IDs to Hugo gene names

The following transformation will be performed upon input into MedBook:
* expression data will be log<sub>2</sub>(n+1) normalized
* rows with duplicate feature labels will be merged (averaged together)


### How to transform TPM data using these scripts
   1. Collect your sample IDs and add them to a file, one per line, eg *samples.txt*.
   2. Determine the path to your sample folders. eg */home/ubuntu/run10*
   3. Run `extract_tpm_columm_from_rsem_genes.results.sh` to create tpm sample files with two columns.
      This will create a folder `output` with a "*samplename*.tpm.tab" file for each sample.
    * `extract_tpm_columm_from_rsem_genes.results.sh "/home/ubuntu/run10" samples.txt`
   4. Run `convert_ensembl_to_hugo.sh samples.txt`. This will create a new output folder `hugo.output`
   
   You now have a folder hugo.output with the sample files with the correct header and feature labels.
   Note that features may have been dropped because the ensembl IDs did not have hugo names. this is expected.
   
   To combine the samples into one file for import into MedBook, use the combined_samples.py script found elsewhere in this repo. Note that `sample_paths.txt` has been created for you.
   
   5. Also copy the TPM files back to the original output folders. To do this :
     * `place_tpm_in_original_output.sh `*`original_basedir`*` samples.txt`
    
### Problems you may run into
 #### extract_tpm_columm can't find file or directory
 The basedir is assumed to be in the format SAMPLENAME/rnaseq/RSEM/Hugo. If it's not (most often would be missing rnaseq) - it won't find the sample. Modify the script to match the format that the basedir is in
 
 ### Permission denied when placing tpm in original output folders
 You need to get the folders writable by you. There's an example script `make_group_writable.sh` to use for guidance. Note that someone with write access to the original folders is the one who can run this, not you.
 
 If you have Docker access, you can mount the output folders as a docker volume and chmod it from there. Example:
 `docker run --rm -it -v /path/to/original/dir/:/samples ubuntu /bin/bash`
